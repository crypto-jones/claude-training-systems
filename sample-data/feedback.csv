2026-01-14-ACME,Sarah Chen,2026-01-14,1.0,18,zoom,backend,72,40,4,5,2,bug1,"What about async?|Does this work with streaming?",Section 6,2,false,"Room engaged until Section 6. Bug 1 took longest - many didn't understand why full history was needed.","The inventory use case in the hook landed really well - three people immediately said it matched their exact problem."
2026-01-16-GLOB,Marcus Reid,2026-01-16,1.0,24,in-person,mixed,85,55,5,5,3,bug2,"Can Claude call tools in parallel by default?|What's the token cost of tool schemas?","",4,true,"Setup issues ate 7 minutes. Bug 2 was fastest fix - demo landed well. Section 6 energy held better in person than I expected.","Asking the room to explain the two-round-trip pattern in their own words before Exercise 1 - several got it exactly right and it visibly boosted confidence."
2026-01-19-NOVA,Priya Patel,2026-01-19,1.0,12,zoom,data,60,25,3,4,2,bug3,"How do we handle large query results?|What if the tool needs auth tokens?",Demo Part 2,1,false,"Data team struggled with JSON schema syntax more than expected. Bug 3 confusing because it didn't always fail.","The mock weather function being visible in the same file made participants much more comfortable - they could see the whole system."
2026-01-22-STRM,James Wright,2026-01-22,1.0,30,in-person,backend,90,65,5,5,4,bug1,"Is there a way to force tool use?|How do we prevent tool loops in production?","",6,false,"Largest group so far. Buddy system worked extremely well at this size. Bug 1 still the hardest conceptually.","Drawing the two-round-trip diagram on a physical whiteboard instead of showing a slide - people photographed it and referred back to it."
2026-01-25-FINX,Aisha Koroma,2026-01-25,1.0,15,zoom,data,55,20,3,3,2,bug1,"What happens if max_tokens cuts off mid-tool-use?|Can we use tools with Claude.ai directly?",Section 6,0,true,"Setup issues significant - 4 participants couldn't get API keys working during session. Data teams less familiar with API concepts generally.","The 'close laptops halfway' instruction after exercises - it genuinely refocused attention and felt natural."
2026-02-03-HELIX,Marcus Reid,2026-02-03,1.1,22,zoom,mixed,80,50,4,5,3,bug2,"How does tool use interact with system prompts?|What's the best way to test tool definitions?","",3,false,"Version 1.1 felt tighter in Section 6. The pitfall table format much easier to move through than prose. Bug 2 still shows up but participants recover faster.","The checkpoint questions at minute 33 - asking people to think silently rather than answer out loud removed pressure and people seemed more engaged afterward."
2026-02-07-CYAN,Sarah Chen,2026-02-07,1.1,20,in-person,backend,88,60,5,5,4,bug3,"Can tools access external URLs directly?|How do we version tool schemas?",Demo Part 2,4,false,"Second time running this. Much more comfortable. Demo Part 2 still the most technically dense section - may need another example.","The stretch prompt about Tesla and jacket - at least half the room tried it and the conversation about tool description quality was the best of the session."
2026-02-10-PRAX,Daniel Osei,2026-02-10,1.1,16,zoom,devops,75,45,4,4,3,bug1,"How do we handle tool timeouts?|What's the pattern for tools that need multiple steps?",Section 6,2,false,"DevOps team very comfortable with APIs but less familiar with LLM concepts generally. Hook needed more time - the inventory example felt distant from their world.","Framing tool use as 'your code stays in control, Claude just requests' - a DevOps participant said that reframe made the security model click immediately."
